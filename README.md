# Project Name

This project consists of two main components: a backend and a frontend.

## Backend

The backend is developed using Node.js and is deployed on Render. It serves as the server-side logic for the application.

### Deployment

The backend is deployed and accessible at the following URL:

[Backend Deployment on Render](https://backend-chat-app-zoni.onrender.com)

### Running Locally

To run the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
4. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
5. Start the server using `npm start`.

## Frontend

The frontend is developed using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is deployed on Vercel and contains the user interface for the application.

### Deployment

The frontend is deployed and accessible at the following URL:

[Frontend Deployment on Vercel](https://frontend-chat-app-one.vercel.app/)

### Running Locally

Since the frontend is built using static files, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to run it locally. Alternatively, you can use a local server like `http-server` or `live-server`.
